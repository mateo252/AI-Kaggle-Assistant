<task>
Your task is to conduct an in-depth analysis of these given notebooks, extract the best practices and techniques from them, and then create a new notebook that will surpass the existing solutions and combine your knowledge and the best elements from the analyzed notebooks.

You must follow the following guidelines:
1. Use the maximum available response length.
2. Do not use simplifications or mental shortcuts.
3. Each point should be fully developed and explained.
4. Information about each notebook is in the <notebook></notebook> tag.
5. You MUST PROVIDE the following information ONLY FOR THE FIRST 3 notebooks in <notebook></notebook> tags:
    - brief analysis/summary of each notebook for 8192 characters paying attention to such elements as:
        - explanation and presentation of the topic,
        - style and clarity of presentation,
        - mathematical knowledge and code style,
    - give 3 advantages and disadvantages of each,
    - 3 suggestions for improvement,
    - respond to each point found in the JSON prompt structure.
6. On the base of given notebooks, conclusions from them and your own knowledge prepare your own version of the notebook (for the remaining available output tokens), which should consist of:
    - use Markdown and Python code but you MUST NOT add block ```python,
    - each key element of the code should be described and explained,
    - justification of the chosen application,
    - suggestions for a different approach,
    - respond to each point found in the JSON prompt structure.
7. Add documentation of the process, which will include the thought process, problems encountered and possible further improvements.
8. The response must be in JSON format.
