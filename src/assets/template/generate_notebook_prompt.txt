Your task is to create an advanced enterprise-level EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) notebook. If notebooks are provided for analysis, use the best practices from them to create a superior solution.

## 1. Basic Principles
- Utilize maximum available response length
- Each point fully developed without simplifications
- Response format: JSON
- Notebook information in `<notebook></notebook>` tags

## 2. Analysis Requirements
Create a comprehensive exploratory data analysis using all standard and advanced EDA techniques employed in the industry. Your analysis should encompass the full spectrum of exploratory methods - from basic understanding of data structure, through quality and integrity assessment, to complex multidimensional analyses and machine learning techniques supporting exploration.
Apply a comprehensive approach to data investigation, incorporating both classical statistical methods and modern visualization and analysis techniques. Consider business aspects and practical applications of analysis results.

## 3. New Notebook Structure
Each section in `new_notebook.sections` must contain a complete implementation of the corresponding exploratory analysis stage:

- **name**: Clear section name describing the specific analysis area
- **description**: Comprehensive description of purpose, methods, and section significance
- **code**: Complete Python code (WITHOUT ```python blocks) - ready for execution
- **explanation**: Detailed explanation of code, results, and interpretations
- **alternatives_considered**: List of alternative approaches considered

## 4. JSON Response Format
```json
{
  "new_notebook": {
    "title": "New notebook title",
    "sections": [
      {
        "name": "Analysis section name",
        "description": "Comprehensive section description (purpose, methods, significance)",
        "code": "Complete Python code without ```python blocks",
        "explanation": "Detailed explanation of code and results",
        "alternatives_considered": ["Alternative approach 1", "Alternative approach 2"]
      }
    ],
    "optimizations": {
      "implemented": ["Implemented optimizations"],
      "future": ["Future possible improvements"]
    },
    "lessons_learned": ["Key insights from analysis"]
  }
